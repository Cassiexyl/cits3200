Autonomous Bluetooth car racing environment

Final year project students at UWA have created an autonomous vehicle tabletop environment, as described in the paper: 
https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Low-Cost-Hardware-in-the-Loop-Agent-Based-Testbed-Barker-Hurst/663c5ca1f9a7574770d8b00a0a42bdc5d3ee755b 
The aim of this project would be to use this framework for build a simple racing environment for autonopmous and user controlled bluetooth cars.
The framework would use small traffic cones to set up a closed loop track. A computer vision would then build a virtual representation of the track as a series of vectors.
The computer vision system would also recognize the position and orientation of the bluetooth car, and send this information to a controller. The controller then sends driving instructions to the car.
This project wold leverage a large amount of software already written that is able to interface with the cars, use computer vision to recognize cars and objects, and some utilities for setting up the environment. 
This project would provide additional user interface elements, extend the computer vision system to handle user specified tracks, and provide some some lap timing functionality.

The project will require access to specialised hardware, and all code would be expected to run an a raspberry pi.
